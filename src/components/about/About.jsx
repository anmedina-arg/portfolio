            I am a proactive and responsible person. I like new challenges,
            research, study and learn new things. This has led me to train as a
            Full Stack Developer with main stack JavaScript and Node Js. I
            developed my experience in the IT world at Henry's bootcamp, where I
            have carried out different projects, individually and as a team! In
            addition, I generated solid and important soft skills during his 12
            years of experience as an Industrial Engineer where I led work
            teams, developing people in soft skills such as communication,
            feedback, inclusion, diversity, teamwork and continuous improvement.
